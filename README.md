The script "script.py" is a basic Python program that greets the user with their name and performs a mathematical operation on two numbers based on the operator inputted by the user.

The program starts by asking for the user's name and then greets them with it. It then prompts the user to enter two numbers and the operator they want to use (+, -, *, or /). The program checks for the operator and performs the corresponding mathematical operation. If an invalid operator is entered, the program prints an error message.

This script is a simple demonstration of Python's basic syntax and input/output operations.
